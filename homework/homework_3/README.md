Your code and results are to be submitted electronically in one zipped (or tarball-ed) file through the [CourseWorks](https://courseworks2.columbia.edu/courses/77738) site. All solutions should be contained in the corresponding files provided here. Code should be written in bash / R and should not have complex dependencies on non-standard libraries. Each problem contains an Rmarkdown file which should be rendered as a pdf to be submitted with your solution. All work should be your own and done individually.
